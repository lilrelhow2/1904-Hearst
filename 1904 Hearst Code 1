Following his media successes, he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1902. At the 1904 Democratic convention, with conservative Alton Parker close to the nomination, former Presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan threw his full weight behind Hearst, to prevent conservatives of the Democratic party from taking back power from the progressives. \n<p> Coming into the election as a steep underdog, to win Hearst needs to reunify the divided Democratic party, by convincing conservatives to not bolt for Parker’s third party, and find a way to criticize popular incumbent President Theodore Roosevelt.",

No one expected you to win and defeat the popular incumbent Roosevelt. Maybe it is because of the nation being tired of Republicanism, or the appeal of your form of Democratic progressivism, but you completely beat Roosevelt. Everyone is in shock, including you. \n<p>This will go down in the history books as one of the biggest upset victories in all of American politics, and for years scholars will study your unlikely victory. \nFor now however, you need to strengthen up your relations with Congress, since Republicans have retained control over the House and Senate. \n<p>The road for your progressive causes will not be easy, and it is likely the Republicans will stall your agenda, and will try to block your legislation.\n<p>Good luck, President Hearst!",

One day however, maybe a Democratic progressive will win the Presidency. \n<p>For now however, you will go back to the House and New York City, where you still have your newspapers and the New York seat. With any luck, maybe in 1908 you could try to run for the Presidency again, or Governor of New York ",
